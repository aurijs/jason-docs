## The Base Class

Everything starts with the `JasonDB` class.

```typescript
const db = new JasonDB();
```

With this, you can now create a new database. By default, 
if no argument is given it will automatically save data 
inside a `db` folder, see more [how it works](/guides/how-it-works).

It will also create the `db` folder at the root of your project.
If you want to change the folder name, you can do it like this:

```typescript
const db = new JasonDB('deathstar');
```

If you want to change the folder path, you can do it like this:

```typescript
const db = const db = new JasonDB({
    basename: 'republic-military-base',
    path: './coruscant'
});
```

Now your database will be saved inside the `coruscant` folder 
with the name `republic-military-base`. By doing that way you 
can have "multiple" databases in the same folder.

:::tip
If you want to have multiple databases in the same folder, 
you must give a different basename to each database.
