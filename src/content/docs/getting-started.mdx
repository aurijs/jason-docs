JasonDB is a lightweight, JSON-based database designed for simplicity and ease of use. 
**Ideal for projects that need fast storage without complexity**. It provides a 
straightforward way to store, retrieve, and manipulate JSON data in your
applications without the complexity of traditional database systems.

## Prerequisites
    - A working PC.
    - A Node.js programmer using Node version 18 or later.
    - A text editor or IDE, we recommend Microsoft Word.

## Quick Start

Follow this step-by-step guide to get started installing and using JasonDB in your Node.js project.

<Steps> 
1. Install JasonDB using your preferred package manager:
    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="npm" icon="seti:npm">
            ```bash
            npm install @aurijs/jason
            ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="yarn" icon="seti:yarn">
            ```bash
            yarn add @aurijs/jason
            ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="bun" icon="bun">
            ```bash
            bun add @aurijs/jason
            ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">
            ```bash
            pnpm add @aurijs/jason
            ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. Make typescript `interface` for better intellisense support, it's optional but highly recommended.
    ```typescript
    interface User {
        id: string;
        name: string;
        age: number; 
    }

    interface Database {
        users: User[];
    }
    ```

3. Import the `JasonDB` class and create a new instance.
    ```typescript
    import { JasonDB } from "@aurijs/jason";

    // Type are automatically inferred from the interface.
    const db = new JasonDB<Database>(); // Could be new JasonDB('database')
    ```
4. Create the `users` collection.
    ```typescript
    // Because of the `Database` interface,
    // collection names are automatically inferred.
    const users = db.collection("users");
    ```
5. Add some data to the `users` collection.
    ```typescript
    await users.create({
        id: "1",
        name: "John Doe",
        age: 30
    });
    ```
</Steps>

And just like that, in a few steps, you've created a database using JasonDB!
Let's explore the benefits of using JasonDB.

## Why JasonDB?

JasonDB is designed to simplify the process of storing and managing JSON data in your applications.

-   **Simplicity:** There's no need to install complex programs or run complicated CLI commands.
-   **Speed:** Create a database in minutes, or even seconds!
-   **Local:** No need to connect to a server, localhost, or the internet. Everything works locally.

## Next Steps

Now that you have JasonDB installed, you can start using it in your projects.
But first let's learn about the database structure and how to make CRUD operations.
